The Assignment
==============

The goal of the Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch assignment is to build:

1. __A Shiny application__ that has widget input, ui input in `server.R`, reactive output using server calculations, and supporting documentation. __A Shiny application__ also comprises of `helper.R` that is used to read the data pertaining to bikes, bike shops and orders for bikes across different states in US. This helper file is invoked via the `server.R`.

2. __A Reproducible Pitch Presentation__ that contains five slides in either Slidify or Rstudio Presenter that is pushed to and hosted on GitHub or Rpubs and contains embedded `R` code that runs. 
Dataset for Sales Analytics Dashboard
=====================================
The data was simulated using a set of scripts I created as part of a side project called `order SimulatoR`. The data simulation is intended to mimic real-world sales data for an organization. The data contains information related to customer orders such as order.id, products purchased, customer information (name and location), unit price, quantity sold, and so on. The simulated data was then used for analysis purposes as part of the __Sales Analytics Dashboard__. 

The list of Datasets used for this project is as follows:

1.  bikes.xlsx
2.  bikeshops.xlsx
3.  orders.xlsx

The Purpose of Sales Analytics Dashboard
========================================

#### Make Selections to Unlock Insights


There's a lot you can do with the __Sales Analytics Dashboard__. 

Imagine you are an executive at an organization in charge of strategy and business development. Your goal is to understand which products 
customers are purchasing, which customers are purchasing the most, and what the organization can do to improve sales.

The Use of Sales Analytics Dashboard
====================================

Here's a few suggestion to get started:

* Use the __Reactive Inputs__ to filter by year, product unit price, product primary category, and product secondary category. 

* On the __Analysis__ tab, see how the filters can be used to drill into the information. See if there are any insights that you can come up with  
  from the data.

* Switch to the __Data__ tab to see how the filters control the data. Subset the data, and try downloading the csv file. 

* Use the __Reset Fields__ button when finished. See how the data set refreshs to its original size   and how all of the reactive inputs reset.
